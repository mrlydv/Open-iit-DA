## In this project, we are given the geodemographic and other relevant data
of an Auto Insurance Company that may impact its Customer Lifetime
Value. We have to predict the Customer Lifetime Value for this company.
Customer Lifetime Value is the total revenue the client will derive in its
entire relationship with a customer. Because we don’t know how long
each customer relationship will be, we have to make a good estimate and
state Customer Lifetime Value as a periodic value - that is, we usually say
“that this customer’s 12 month(or 24 months, etc) Customer Lifetime
Value is $x.
The client also wants to know the types of customers that would
generally give us more revenue.
